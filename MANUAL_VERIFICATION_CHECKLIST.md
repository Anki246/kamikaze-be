- [ ] Go to: https://github.com/Anki246/kamikaze-be/actions
- [ ] Find "Simple Secrets Test" workflow
- [ ] Click "Run workflow" dropdown
- [ ] Click "Run workflow" button
- [ ] Wait for workflow to complete

### **4.2 Check Test Results**
**Expected SUCCESS results:**
```
‚úÖ GITHUB_TOKEN is available
‚úÖ SIMPLE_TEST secret is accessible: hello
‚úÖ AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID is accessible
‚úÖ AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY is accessible
```

**If still FAILING:**
```
‚ùå GITHUB_TOKEN is NOT available
‚ùå SIMPLE_TEST secret is NOT accessible
```

## üîç **TROUBLESHOOTING**

### **Issue 1: Can't Access Repository Settings**
**Symptoms**: 404 or "You don't have access" on settings page
**Solution**: 
- Check if you're logged into the correct GitHub account
- Verify you have admin access to the repository
- Contact repository owner if needed

### **Issue 2: Actions Settings Not Available**
**Symptoms**: No "Actions" tab in repository settings
**Solution**:
- Repository might be in an organization with restricted Actions
- Contact organization admin
- Check organization-level Actions policies

### **Issue 3: Can't Save Actions Settings**
**Symptoms**: Settings don't save or revert back
**Solution**:
- Check for organization-level restrictions
- Ensure you have admin permissions
- Try refreshing page and saving again

### **Issue 4: Secrets Page Not Accessible**
**Symptoms**: Can't access secrets page or add secrets
**Solution**:
- Verify Actions are enabled first (Step 2)
- Check repository permissions
- Ensure no organization restrictions

### **Issue 5: Test Workflow Still Fails**
**Symptoms**: GITHUB_TOKEN still not available after configuration
**Solution**:
- Wait 5-10 minutes for settings to propagate
- Try running workflow again
- Check if repository is forked (forks have limited secret access)

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Configuration Complete When:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ Can access all repository settings pages
- [ ] ‚úÖ GitHub Actions is enabled with "Allow all actions"
- [ ] ‚úÖ Workflow permissions set to "Read and write"
- [ ] ‚úÖ All required secrets are added and visible
- [ ] ‚úÖ Simple test workflow shows GITHUB_TOKEN available
- [ ] ‚úÖ Simple test workflow shows secrets accessible

### **Ready for Main Pipeline When:**
- [ ] ‚úÖ All above criteria met
- [ ] ‚úÖ AWS credentials are valid and working
- [ ] ‚úÖ Simple test workflow passes completely

## üìû **If Still Failing After All Steps**

### **Possible Advanced Issues:**
1. **Repository is a fork**: Forks have limited secret access
2. **Organization restrictions**: Admin has disabled Actions/secrets
3. **Account-level issues**: GitHub account has restrictions
4. **Regional restrictions**: Some regions have limited GitHub features

### **Emergency Alternatives:**
1. **Create new personal repository** for testing
2. **Use different GitHub account** if current has restrictions
3. **Contact GitHub Support** for account-level issues
